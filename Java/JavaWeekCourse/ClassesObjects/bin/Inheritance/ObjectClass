The Object Class:

There is one special class, Object, defined by Java. All other classes are subclasses of Object.
That is, Object is a superclass of all other classes. This means that a reference variable of
type Object can refer to an object of any other class. Also, since arrays are implemented as
classes, a variable of type Object can also refer to any array.
Object defines the following methods, which means that they are available in every object.

Methods:

Object clone( ):
	Creates a new object that is the same as the object being cloned.

boolean equals(Object object)
	Determines whether one object is equal to another.

void finalize( )
	Called before an unused object is recycled.

Class<?> getClass( )
	Obtains the class of an object at run time.

int hashCode( )
	Returns the hash code associated with the invoking object.

void notify( )
	Resumes execution of a thread waiting on the invoking object.

void notifyAll( )
Resumes execution of all threads waiting on the invoking object.

String toString( )
	Returns a string that describes the object.
